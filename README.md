  <p align="center">
    My grandmother, DeeDee, was notorious for many things, among which were her cooking, and her stories. 
    <p>DeeDee's Recipes allows users to post and browse through recipes that have a memory or story attatched to them, because every dish has a memory, and every memory deserves a place to tell the story.</p>
  <p>This is my very first React app and serves as my Nashville Software School front-end capstone project.</p>
